     * The purpose of JDBC is to have your application be able to communicate with a relational database
     * JDBC is an API included with Java (java.sql)
     *
     * JDBC is able to communicate with a variety of different databases
     * through the use of JDBC drivers
     *
     * These drivers are managed using the JDBC Driver Manager
     *
     * In order to obtain a connection, we need to have the driver loaded, and provide credentials such as our username, password, and
     * connection string
     *
     * Some important classes
     * 1. java.sql.DriverManager
     * 2. java.sql.Connection
     * 3. java.sql.Statement
     * 4. java.sql.ResultSet
     *
     * A general workflow might be
     * 1. Establish a connection
     * 2. Create a Statement object
     * 3. Execute a SQL query from that statement object
     * 4. Process data from the ResultSet
     *
     * WIthin this utility class, we will have a static method that retrieves a connection to the DB, or creates a connection
